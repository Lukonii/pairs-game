You want to try game. Just start pairs.exe <br/>
But if you want to edit code and modify game by your own, than follow some steps.

1. Install compiler.</br>
    -download compiler from my google drive link https://drive.google.com/file/d/16PgoOr4eKKM5yI9_vmnvN5IjtdEHfq6V/view?usp=sharing</br>
    -start installation</br>
    -go to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin and in that folder copy bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg from .rar document you downloaded from my drive.</br>
2. Copy files.</br>
    -in C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin copy pairs.cpp</br>
    -in C:\Borland\BCC55\Include copy defkey.h</br>
3. Compile files.</br>
    -your projcet should be located in C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin folder and also compiled there</br>
    -start cmd and navigate to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin to compile code in cmd enter bcc32 [name of your project].cpp (in this case MasterMind.cpp)</br>
